      "Body: As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.\n",
      "\n",
      "What have I learned?\n",
      "\n",
      "Even a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  \"YOLOing\" your rent check is never a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at >$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D\n",

He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. \n",

      "**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n",

      "###**FAQs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n",
      "\n",
      "**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n",

This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\n",

That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years.

      "**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n",

      "For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n",

The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company.

      "Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n",

      "> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound – financials, airlines and industrials – stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “He’s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. “It is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.”\n",
      "*****\n",

      "*****\n",
      "> # Improving forecasts\n",
      "> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n",

      "> ″[Powell’s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He’s going to be supportive of the administration’s effort to get a big package through,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n",

      "*****\n",
      "> “I think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “I think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,” he said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that’s going to go away sooner than we think,” Keon said. “Right now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That’s also due to the fact we’re likely to get a big stimulus package.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “I think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We’re still bullish. We’re still overweight stocks,” Keon said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,” Keon added. “Households now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. “You’re going to see an incredible boom.”\n",

      "> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n",

      "> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n",

While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n",

      "> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals—as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index—are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n",

In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n",

      "> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage “stairs up, elevator down” certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn’t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n",
      "\n",
      "> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it’s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n",
      "\n",
      "> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in “stay at home” themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. “It’s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Drawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.” If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year’s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

      "> # Stimulus Matters: Retail Sales Rebound Big in January\n",
      "\n",
      "> The US economy had a tumultuous year in 2020, to say the least, and after rebounding strongly in the third quarter, the holiday surge in COVID-19 cases increased the risk that the economy may stumble heading into the new year. The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December—ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales—consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau—the most in seven months—and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Fiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January’s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn’t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4–4.5% to 5–5.5%. Yesterday’s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target—and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden’s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n",

      "\n",
      "> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n",

      "\n",
      "> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n",

Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%.

For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n",

      "> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n",

Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n",

It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n",
      "\n",
      "**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n",

The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n",

      "European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes.\n",

I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n",

In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n",

It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n",

      "#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n",
      "\n",
      "One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let’s start with…\n",
      "\n",
      "**How does NVDA make money?**\n",
      "\n",
      "NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a GPU?**\n",
      "\n",
      "NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Gaming Market:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)\n",
      "\n",
      "GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Some more Modern History**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):\n",
      "\n",
      "📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:\n",
      "\n",
      "📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)\n",
      "\n",
      "This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).\n",
      "\n",
      "📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!\n",
      "\n",
      "So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:\n",
      "\n",
      "📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)\n",
      "\n",
      "Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:\n",

      "\n",
      "This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?\n",
      "\n",
      "The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Professional Market:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)\n",
      "\n",
      "As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Some More Modern History**\n",
      "\n",
      "NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)\n",
      "2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)\n",
      "3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)\n",
      "4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)\n",

      "\n",
      "It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Machine Learning?**\n",
      "\n",
      "At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.\n",
      "\n",
      "So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:\n",

      "\n",
      "Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.\n",

      "**Back to the Competitive Picture**\n",
      "\n",
      "**For the Tesla Segment**\n",
      "\n",
      "So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.\n",
      "\n",
      "NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:\n",

      "With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.\n",

      "**Pulling things together**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.\n",

It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them.

That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!\n",

Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.\n",

      "Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.\n",

The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”\"\n",

      "  dy: ARTICLE TLDR: Amazon is investing a whopping $150 billion over 15 years to build data centers, anticipating a surge in demand for AI and digital services. This move aims to cement Amazon's lead in cloud services and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, Amazon is allocating over $1 billion this year to Nvidia's new Blackwell AI data center, further underlining its commitment to staying ahead in the tech race. With previous significant expenditures and strategic acquisitions, Amazon signals a bullish stance on profitability and market dominance.\n",

      "Body: Currently Nvidia has a market cap of 2.62T, making it the 3rd largest market cap company in US. This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.\n",

Thoughts like \"it was in front of me all along, but for some reason, I was too scared to put money into it\" were common. But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of 'ideas' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past.

The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.\n",

      "Body: I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it’s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. \n",
      "\n",
      "**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. \n",
      "\n",
      "A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube.\n",

      "Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  \n",
      "It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.  \n",

      "There will be \"dozens\" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).  \n",
      "Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.  \n",

The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.  \n",

      "Body: Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \\~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \\~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. \n",
      "\n",
      "But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Stock split = $$$  \n",
      "\n",
      "3) My local Costco has long lines \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said \"Costco stock is too expensive\" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. \n",
      "\n",
      "A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. \n",
      "\n",
      "And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. \n",
      "\n",
      "- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) \n",
      "\n",
      "- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco\n",
      "\n",
      "- As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend \n",
      "\n",
      "- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect \n",
      "\n",
      "- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals\n",
      "\n",
      "- Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not \n",
      "\n",
      "- eCommerce margins are still unclear along with the impact of Instacart on memberships\n",

      "*****\n",
      "> The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> # No correction yet\n",
      "> As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He said earnings for the S&P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.\n",

      "\n",
      "> While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.\n",

      "\n",
      "> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\n",
      "\n",
      "> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%.

      "> # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong\n",
      "\n",
      "> The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.\n",

      "\n",
      "> Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.\n",

      "\n",
      "> In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.\n",

      "> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin\n",
      "\n",
      "> The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.\n",

      "> Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.\n",

      "> As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.\n",

      "> The S&P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.\n",

That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.\n",

      "> Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

      "It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.\n",

      "The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. \n",

      "“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. \n",
      "\n",
      "***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.\n",

      "\n",
      "Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. \n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. \n",

      "Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. \n",
      "\n",
      "One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.\n",

Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  \n",

The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.\n",

      "Is it just me or do these guys just raise their price targets as the stock soars so their performance on websites like tipranks doesn't suffer? Nothing about nvidia's performance has changed this quarter that would suddenly warrant an increase of nvidia's market cap by 300 billion dollars. I think price targets are an important tool, especially for retail investors, but lately these guys seem to just make it up as they go. At $350 nvidia is a 900b company on 10b of forward net earnings. That's just bonkers and these guys seem to base their price targets on how far they think the current bull market can inflate the ever increasing sentiment instead of what the stock is fundamentally worth.\n",

The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”\n",
      "*****\n",

      "*****\n",
      "> “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.\n",

      "> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n",
      "\n",
      "> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n",
      "\n",
      "> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n",

      "> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n",
      "\n",
      "> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n",
      "\n",
      "> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n",
      "\n",
      "> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n",
      "\n",
      "> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n",

      "> # News High for Net New Highs\n",
      "\n",
      "> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n",
      "\n",
      "> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n",

      "> # Breadth Booming\n",
      "\n",
      "> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n",
      "\n",
      "> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n",

      "\n",
      "> October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n",

      "\n",
      "Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia. \n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images; instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership. \n",
      "\n",
      "These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year. \n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.\n",
      "\n",
      "FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”\n",

      "Body: Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla’s stock price is down 29% this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million “Dojo” supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.\n",
      "\n",
      "The memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Information previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conflicts of interest\n",
      "\n",
      "While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla’s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk’s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.\n",
      "\n",
      "A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia’s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.\n",

      "Less supply to balance out demand—and keep prices high.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the PC industry flounders, Intel suffered from such disastrous sales last quarter that it instituted pay cuts and other extreme measures going forward. AMD’s client PC sales also dropped dramatically—a whopping 51 percent year-over-year—but the company managed to eke out a small profit despite the sky falling. So why aren’t CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters,” Su said, as spotted by PC Gamer. “We undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the pandemic winding down and inflation ramping up, far fewer people are buying CPUs, GPUs, and PCs. It’s a hard, sudden reverse from just months ago, when companies like Nvidia and AMD were churning out graphic cards as quickly as possible to keep up with booming demand from cryptocurrency miners and PC gamers alike. Now that GPU mining is dead, shelves are brimming with unsold chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the painfully high price tags of new next-gen GPUs, last-gen GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards are still selling for very high prices considering their two-year-old status. Strategic under-shipping helps companies maintain higher prices for their wares.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMD isn’t the only one doing it, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through that we’re seeing,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said to investors in November. “So we have been undershipping. We have been undershipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, Nvidia has released the $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080 and $800 RTX 4070 Ti, two wildly overpriced graphics cards, and tried positioning them as enthusiast-grade upsells over the RTX 30-series, rather than treating them like the usual cyclical upgrades. AMD’s $900 Radeon RX 7900 XT offers similarly disappointing value and the company recently released a blog post also positioning its new GPUs as enthusiast-grade upsells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall gross margin is a key metric for chip companies, which burn through a ton of cash investing in R&D and cutting-edge technological processes. AMD’s market tricks helped it achieve a 51 percent non-GAAP gross margin last quarter, while Intel forecasted a terrifyingly low 34.1 percent gross margin for the upcoming quarter (hence its belt-tightening moves).\n",
      "\n",
      "This all helps explain why street prices for standalone GPUs haven’t plummeted, even as deals on desktops and laptops have started ramping up. We expect—hope?—that as stocks dwindle down and competition ramps up, sanity will return to graphics card prices, mirroring AMD and Intel’s recent CPU price adjustments. Just this morning, Intel announced that its Arc A750 graphics card was getting a price cut to $250, instantly making it an all-too-rare tempting target for PC gamers on a budget.\n",

      "Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.\n",

      "# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there’s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Investors’ focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government’s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on “60 Minutes” Sunday night.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The S&P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> # Home sweet home\n",
      "> “Housing is going to be important in that you’ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,” said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. “That’s going to be an issue. One of the key things we’re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There’s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren’t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. “That’s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,” she said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe’s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “Market reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. “The markets right now don’t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> # Solvency concerns\n",
      "> The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “There’s an interesting kind of threshold here as we’re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We’re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,” said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That’s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,” Arone said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. “The reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,” he said. “Look out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Emanuel said the Fed’s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we’re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we’re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don’t have reason to believe that’s not the case,” he said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a ‘B’ of ‘B+’ based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “If all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that’s going to be injected into peoples’ arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,” Emanuel said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> # Range bound\n",
      "> For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “We have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It’s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,” said Emanuel.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “I think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,” he said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “On a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it’s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,” Emanuel said. “If you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don’t necessarily know if that’s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “Part of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they’ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn’t a ton of fuel for the downside there,” said Emanuel.\n",

      "# Retail Sales Telling the Economy’s Story\n",
      "\n",
      "> Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n",
      "\n",
      "> The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> “One of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “As the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there”\n",
      "\n",
      "> For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "> While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "*****\n",
      "\n",
      "# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n",
      "\n",
      "> As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n",
      "\n",
      "> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> While stocks look expensive on this metric—one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs—valuations may be getting too much attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Stocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “While the return to 2019’s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n",
      "\n",
      "> * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we’ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year’s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n",
      "> * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn’t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock’s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n",
      "> * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we’re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "*****\n",
      "\n",
      "# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n",
      "\n",
      "> Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “From COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n",
      "\n",
      "> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n",

      "# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n",

      "> Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Today’s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n",

      "# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n",
      "\n",
      "> The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n",

      "> While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future.

      "> One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n",

      "# Investors Remain On Guard\n",
      "\n",
      "> In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "> The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&P 500.\n",
      "\n",
      "> While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n",

      "Body:  This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "What is packaging?\n",
      "\n",
      "The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n",
      "\n",
      "3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chiplets\n",
      "\n",
      "Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n",
      "\n",
      "3D stacking\n",
      "\n",
      "In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n",
      "2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n",
      "3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n",

      "\n",
      "The layoffs will be announced as early as this month, with the company planning to make the move around the same time as its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 27, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.\n",

      "Some divisions, including Intel’s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people familiar with the situation.\n",

      "Intel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of nearly 20%. And Intel’s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They’re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%. \n",

      "During its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes in its business to improve profits. “We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.\n",

      "Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total. The company has made smaller cuts since then and shuttered several divisions, including its cellular modem and drone units. Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew.\n",

      "Gelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company’s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend. But even before the PC slump, it was an uphill fight. Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company’s culture of innovation withered in recent years.\n",

      "It’s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks. The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US. Gelsinger is planning a building boom that includes bringing the world’s biggest chipmaking hub to Ohio. \n",

      "Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund has rallied more than 50% this year. Investors are using that as an opportunity to get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have pulled a net $717 million from the ARK Innovation ETF over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. That exodus marks a notable shift for a fund that had consistently drawn investor cash since its 2014 inception. Once the largest actively managed ETF with nearly $30 billion in assets under management, the fund has shrunk to roughly $9 billion, mostly due to investment losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Known by its ticker symbol ARKK, Wood’s fund became an investor darling shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with hugely successful bets on unprofitable and “disruptive” technology companies. It took in huge amounts of investor money, culminating with a $6.5 billion inflow in the first quarter of 2021, when its share price peaked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the Federal Reserve’s fastest interest-rate hiking campaign in decades crushed the valuations of unprofitable growth companies, which often attract investors when interest rates are low and returns on safer investments such as CDs are minimal. Shares of ARKK plunged 67% in 2022, but its investors largely held on or bought the dip. Now, analysts say they expect some of those investors are getting out for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a whole group of people who got in somewhere near the top and are sitting on horrific losses,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, which operates an inverse ETF that lets investors bet against Wood’s fund. “I think some of those people have said, ‘I’m never getting back to even; this is probably the best I’m going to do, and it’s time to get out.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wood says the outflows have been small compared with the fund’s assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been astonished at our asset retention since February of ‘21,” Wood said in an interview. “It’s a very small number as a percentage of assets, which suggests that it’s far more likely to be people who are taking some profits than some exodus of people who have stayed in the fund through a prolonged down period.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the recent rally, ARKK shares are trading about 70% below their all-time high. The S&P 500 has climbed 17% this year on hopes the Fed is near the end of its tightening effort; it is still down 6.1% from its early 2022 high.\n",
      "\n",
      "ARKK’s top five holdings are Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Zoom Video Communications and Block. Only Tesla and Zoom were profitable last year. Tesla holds an 11% weight in the fund, helping power its advance this year. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker have more than doubled in 2023 but, like ARKK, are down sharply from their previous high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although technology stocks are strongly back in favor this year, the best performers have mostly been mature, profitable companies that generate significant cash, such as Microsoft and Amazon.com. Unlike two years ago, investors appear to have less interest and patience for companies that aren’t expected to turn a profit until years in the future. Higher interest rates have meant there is a much higher opportunity cost to wait for profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s certainly been a change in sentiment from when the ARK funds were doing really well,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research. “A lot of the stocks the ETF holds won’t have big cash flows until way out in the future, and it’s a more challenging environment for that with rates expected to be higher for longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors say the ARK brand lost its luster after the fund’s prodigious fall. It took another hit after missing out on the monster rally in shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the boom of interest in artificial-intelligence technology. ARKK sold the last of its Nvidia position in January, a stake that had long been one of its largest holdings. Nvidia has been the S&P 500’s best performer this year, more than tripling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bloom is off the rose a little bit,” Tuttle said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wood says the negative publicity over the past two years has been an opportunity for ARK to solidify its brand as an asset manager focused on disruptive innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can tell you at the end of ’20 and early ‘21, when we couldn’t do anything wrong and people were just chasing, I felt very uncomfortable,” she said. “Today, I feel very comfortable. We are not seeing that kind of behavior. That tells me there is a wall of worry out there. And that usually sustains a bull market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The outflows at ARK are coming while ETF investors appear eager to put money to work in other funds. June was the best month for equity ETF flows since October, according to State Street, while active funds attracted $10 billion of inflows for the month and more than $100 billion over the past 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors displayed “childlike exuberance” and “jumped into the market’s rally with both feet,” Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas research for State Street’s ETF business, said in a research note.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ARKK fund has an 11% annualized average return since inception, but the average ARKK investor has lost 21% on a dollar-weighted, annualized basis, according to FactSet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“ARKK shareholders have not timed their purchases well. Many bought high and have yet to sell,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global funds research at FactSet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fund remains a cash cow for Wood, who owns a majority stake in its parent company, ARK Investment Management. Its 0.75% annual fee is about double the average fee for active ETFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although fee revenue is well off its 2021 peak, ARKK has generated more than $20 million of fees this year. ARK Investment Management currently has the third-highest daily revenue from active equity ETFs, of at least 145 different issuers, according to an analysis from FactSet.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, the market comeback staged by many of ARKK’s tech-focused holdings surprised many, highlighting the perils of trying to forecast performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,” said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. “It’s a classic window into why market prognostication doesn’t work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?”\n",

Gelsinger added that following on from Meteor Lake (expected to be launched later this month), Intel will be ramping its Intel 3 process (5 nm) “soon”. Perhaps more excitingly – and tantalizingly – Gelsinger said that Intel has received a large customer pre-payment for its 18A node (1.8 nm) that has already been successfully taped out and is on track for 2025.\n",

TSMC also claims it is on track for its own 2 nm process node in 2025 and already enjoys the patronage of major customers including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, MediaTek along with Apple. Undoubtedly, Intel will be keen to secure at least one of these companies as it helps with its own economies of scale as investing in each of these new process nodes is a multi-billion-dollar endeavor. In the end, the competition in the foundry sector is great for customers as it is driving the delivery of faster, but also more efficient chips.\"\n",

During that time I just finished my bachelors degree in International Business and now I am on the verge of finishing my masters degree in Finance & Banking. Since I was 15-16 years old I always had an interest in the stock market and finance topics in general. Also I always considered myself to be really good with mathematical and statistical concepts, so all in all I thought that I must have an edge on the „regular“ investor in terms of not necessarily being better of just putting my money into index funds. \n",

Over the 4 years I can account for returns around 22% on my portfolio (not per year but over the whole time span), massively underperforming S&P return during the same timespan.

From that point onwards buying and selling single stocks is 90% and mental game as well as some necessary luck. So a lot of the times I picked the right stocks but failed to stick to simple investment rules, and human biases got the better of me. I kept stocks that underperformed in hopes of getting back in the green And sold of stocks I believed in just to realise gains (e.g. selling Nvidia at 160 bc I already doubled the initial investment) \n",

      "During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Powell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Powell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, “What that \\[the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation\\] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. We’re really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it’s a long road to normal from where we are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to \"reprioritize various commitments\" and that he remained \"supportive of the company and its important work,\" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said.\n",

      "To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.\n",

      "Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the \"only-the-paranoid-survive\" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.\n",

      "“TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position.

      "*****\n",
      "> Stocks could hang at record levels but gains may be capped until Congress agrees to a new stimulus package to help the economy and the millions of unemployed Americans.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&P 500 flirted with record levels it set in February.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> In the coming week, there are some major retailers reporting earnings, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, but the season is mostly over and the market is entering a quiet period. There are minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released Wednesday, and housing data, including starts Tuesday and existing sales Friday.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Investors had been watching efforts by Congress to agree to a new stimulus package, but talks have failed and the Senate has gone on recess. There is a concern that Congress will not be convinced to provide a big enough package when it does get to work again on the next stimulus round because recent economic reports look stronger. July’s retail sales, for example, climbed to a record level and recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The juxtaposition of getting more fiscal stimulus and better data has paralyzed us in our tracks … we’ve seen this sideways [market] action,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. “It feels like we need more action from Congress, and the concern is the longer we wait, the better the data gets and the less impactful the next round of stimulus will be.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Some technical analysts say the market may pull back around the high, to allow it to consolidate gains before moving higher into the end of the year. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high of 3,393 on Feb. 19.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Hogan said he expects stocks to tread sideways during the dog days of August, but they could begin to react negatively to the election in September. He also said it is important that progress continue against the spread of Covid-19, as the economy continues to reopen.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the market could have a wakeup call at some point that the stimulus package has not been approved.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “I think it will cross over a line where they care,” he said. “I think the market is in suspended animation of believing there will be a magical deal.” Boockvar said he expects a deal ultimately, but the impact is not likely to be as big as the last round of funding.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “What they’re not grasping is any deal, any extension of unemployment benefits, is going to be smaller than it was, and the rate of change should be the most important thing investors focus on,” he said. “Not the binary outcome of whether there’s a deal or no deal. There’s going to be less air going into the balloon.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> # It’s the economy\n",
      "> Still, economists expect to see a strong rebound in the third quarter, and are anticipating about about a 20% jump in third-quarter growth. But they also say that could be threatened if Congress does not help with another stimulus package.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, described the July retail sales as a perfect V-shaped recovery, but cautioned it would not last unless more aid gets to individuals and cities and states. Democrats have sought a $3 trillion spending package, and Republicans in the Senate offered a $1 trillion package. They could not reach a compromise, including on a $600 weekly payment to individuals on unemployment which expired July 31.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> President Donald Trump has tried to fill the gap with executive orders to provide extra benefits to those on unemployment, but the $300 federal payment and $100 from states may take some time to reach individuals, as the processing varies by state. He has also issued an order instructing the Treasury to temporarily defer collection of payroll taxes from individuals making up to $104,000.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “I think in August and September, there will be a lot of Ws, if there’s not more help here,” said Zandi, referring to an economic recovery that retrenches from a V shape before heading higher again. “It’s clearly perplexing. It may take the stock market to say we’re not going to get what we expect, and sell off and light a fire.”\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Zandi said it could come to a situation like 2008, where the stock market sold off sharply before Congress would agree to a program that helped financial companies.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “We need a TARP moment to get these guys to help. Maybe if the claims tick higher and the August employment numbers are soft, given the president is focused on the stock market, that might be what it takes to get them back to the table in earnest,” he said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped rescue banks during the financial crisis.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> He ultimately expects a package of about $1.5 trillion to be approved in September.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> The lack of funding for state and local governments could result in more layoffs, as they struggle with their current 2021 budgets, Zandi said. Already 1.3 million public sector jobs have been lost since February, and there will be more layoffs and more programs and projects cancelled. The impact will hit contractors and other businesses that provide services to local governments.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The multipliers on state and local government are among the highest of any form of support, so if you don’t provide it, it’s going to ripple through the economy pretty fast,” he said.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> Economists expect to see a softening in consumer spending in August with the more than 28 million Americans on unemployment benefits as of mid-July no longer receiving any supplemental pay.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "> “The real irony is things are shaping up that September is going to be a bad month, and that’s going to show up in all the data in October,” Zandi said. “They are really taking a chance on this election by not acting.”\n",

      "> The S&P 500 Index is a few points away from a new all-time high, completing one of the fastest recoveries from a bear market ever. But this will also seal the deal on the shortest bear market ever. Remember, the S&P 500 Index lost 20% from an all-time high in only 16 trading days back in February and March, so it makes sense that this recovery could be one of the fastest ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "> From the lows on March 23, the S&P 500 has now added more than 50%. Many have been calling this a bear market rally for months, while we have been in the camp this is something more. It’s easy to see why this rally is different based on where it stands versus other bear market rallies:\n",

      "> They say the stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming.

      "\n",
      "> After a historic drop in March, the S&P 500 has closed higher in April, May, June, and July. This rare event has happened only 11 other times, with stocks gaining the final five months of the year a very impressive 10 times. Only 2018 and the nearly 20% collapse in December saw a loss those final five months.\n",

      "> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this bear market will go down as the fastest ever, at just over one month. The recovery back to new highs will be five months if we get there by August 23, making this one of the fastest recoveries ever. Not surprisingly, it usually takes longer for bear markets in a recession to recover; only adding to the impressiveness of this rally.\n",

      "> “It normally takes 30 months for bear markets during a recession to recover their losses, which makes this recovery all the more amazing,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strateigst Ryan Detrick.. “Then again, there has been nothing normal about this recession, so maybe we shouldn’t be shocked about yet another record going down in 2020.”\n",

      "> # When a Few Basis Points Packs a Punch\n",
      "\n",
      "> US Treasury yields have been on the rise this week with the 10-year yield rising 13 basis points (bps) from 0.56% up to 0.69% after getting as high as 0.72% on Thursday. A 13 bps move higher in interest rates may not seem like a whole lot, but with rates already at such low levels, a small move can have a pretty big impact on the prices of longer-term maturities.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-10-Year-Yield.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> Starting with longer-term US Treasuries, TLT, which measures the performance of maturities greater than 20 years, has declined 3.5% this week. Now, for a growth stock, 3.5% is par for the course, but that kind of move in the Treasury market is no small thing. The latest pullback for TLT also coincides with another failed attempt by the ETF to trade and stay above $170 for more than a day.\n",

      "\n",
      "> The further out the maturity window you go in the fixed income market, the bigger the impact of the move higher in interest rates. The Republic of Austria issued a 100-year bond in 2017, and its movements exemplify the wild moves that small changes in interest rates (from a low base) can have on prices. Just this week, the Austrian 100-year was down over 5%, which is a painful move no matter what type of asset class you are talking about. This week's move, though, was nothing compared to the stomach-churning swings from earlier this year. When Covid was first hitting the fan, the 100-year rallied 57% in the span of less than two months. That kind of move usually occurs over years rather than days, but in less than a third of that time, all those gains disintegrated in a two-and-a-half week span from early to late March. Easy come, easy go. Ironically enough, despite all the big up and down moves in this bond over the last year, as we type this, the bond's price is the same now as it was on this same day last year.\n",

      "\n",
      "> At the headline level, July’s Retail Sales report disappointed as the reading missed expectations by nearly a full percentage point. Just as soon as the report was released, we saw a number of stories pounce on the disappointment as a sign that the economy was losing steam. Looked at in more detail, though, the July report wasn’t all that bad. While the headline reading rose less than expected (1.2% vs 2.1%), Ex Autos and Ex Autos and Gas, the results were much better than expected. Not only that, but June’s original readings were all revised higher by around a full percentage point.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Besides the fact that this month’s report was better underneath the surface and June’s reading was revised higher, it was also notable as the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of sales in July hit a new record high. After the last record high back in January, only five months passed until American consumers were back to their pre-Covid spending ways. For the sake of comparison, back during the Financial Crisis, 40 months passed between the original high in Retail Sales in November 2007 and the next record high in April 2011. 5 months versus 40? Never underestimate the power of the US consumer!\n",

The 59.8% gain over the last 100 trading days ranks as the 3rd strongest run on record. The only two stronger 100-day rallies ended in January 1999 and March 2000.\n",

This means tomorrow will mark 100 trading days since the S&P 500's COVID Crash closing low. Right now the rolling 100-day percentage change for the S&P 500 sits at +46.7%. But if the S&P manages to trade at current levels tomorrow, the 100-day gain will jump above 50%. It has been 87 years (1933) since we've seen a 100-day gain of more than 50%!\n",

      "\n",
      "> Whether you want to look at it from the perspective of closing prices or intraday levels, the S&P 500 is doing what just about everybody thought would be impossible less than five months ago - approaching record highs. Relative to its closing high of 3,386.15, the S&P 500 is just 0.27% lower, while it's within half of a percent from its record intraday high of 3,393.52. Through today, the S&P 500 has gone 120 trading days without a record high, and as shown in the chart below, the current streak is barely even visible when viewed in the perspective of all streaks since 1928. Even if we zoom in on just the last five years, the current streak of 120 trading days only ranks as the fourth-longest streak without a new high.\n",
      "\n",
      "> While the S&P 500's 120-trading day streak without a new high isn't extreme by historical standards, the turnaround off the lows has been extraordinary. In the S&P 500's history, there have been ten prior declines of at least 20% from a record closing high. Of those ten prior periods, the shortest gap between the original record high and the next one was 309 trading days, and the shortest gap between highs that had a pullback of at least 30% was 484 tradings days (or more than four times the current gap of 120 trading days). For all ten streaks without a record high, the median drought was 680 trading days.\n",

      "\n",
      "> Whenever the S&P 500 does take out its 2/19 high, the question is whether the new high represents a breakout where the S&P 500 keeps rallying into evergreen territory, or does it run out of gas after finally reaching a new milestone? To shed some light on this question, we looked at the S&P 500's performance following each prior streak of similar duration without a new high.\n",

      "Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a \"prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,\" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. \n",
      "\n",
      "But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.\n",

As internal processes differ from brokerage to brokerage, it may take as many as several days for the new shares to show up in investor accounts.\n",

      "Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's \"velocity\" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its \"acceleration\" (%/day\\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.\n",

      "1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\\_optimize\\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)\n",
      "2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, here’s what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \\*on average\\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see [this](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.\n",
      "3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI>70 to be overbought, and RSI<30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although it’s possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. Take any predictions for stocks with RSI>70 with extreme caution as they are likely to experience a reversal!\n",
      "4. Based on the results of the backtesting, I have changed the maximum SMA from 200 to 50, and have included the third derivative in the price projections.\n",

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

      "\n",
      "The market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. \n",
      "\n",
      "Between Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. \n",

This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence.

However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC.

      "Body: Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!\n",
      "\n",
      "During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's talk about their evaluation…\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.\n",
      "2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.\n",
      "3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.\n",

      "The possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. \n",

      "Body: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 45% in July, accelerating its pace of growth from the June quarter and bolstering hopes for sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales for the month reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts project TSMC revenue should grow 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July result suggesting TSMC may surpass those expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taiwan’s biggest company is one of the key bellwethers for AI demand, as the go-to chipmaker for leading accelerator makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the sole supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, at a time the mobile device market is showing signs of bouncing off post-Covid era lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.\n",

      "TSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings, with Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei signaling the company may have room to raise prices as more of its customers transition to its most advanced technology and have to compete for limited capacity. High-performance computing, led by AI, contributed 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, the first time it has accounted for more than half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, investors have started to question whether the billions of dollars Big Tech firms have invested in the infrastructure to support the AI boom will result in substantial returns, while a potential delay in Nvidia’s development of a new generation of AI chips is spurring concerns over the progress of the emerging technology.\n",

      "What Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, marking its second-highest sales gain in the past 20 months, aligned with our expectations for robust 3Q performance. This surge could indicate sustained, strong AI chip demand and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC is well positioned to beat the top end of its $23.2 billion 3Q sales guidance.\n",

      "For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet\n",
      " said in its earnings report last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”\n",
      "\n",
      "**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”\n",
